# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [5.1.0] - 2026-08-22

### Added

- Added `keepAlive` to `SuperPagination` and every public pagination view wrapper.
- Added `AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin` support so `keepAlive: true` retains the pagination state in lazy tab/page/sliver containers that honor Flutter keep-alive requests.
- Added a dedicated example showing pagination tabs that preserve the same internally-created cubit and scroll controller while off-screen.
- Added regression coverage for the public `keepAlive` API and retained lifecycle behavior.

### Changed

- `keepAlive` defaults to `false`, preserving the existing disposal behavior unless explicitly enabled.
- A runtime change to `keepAlive` now calls `updateKeepAlive()` so Flutter updates the ancestor keep-alive bucket immediately.
- Provider callbacks now receive the active Flutter `BuildContext` together with the request: `(context, request)`.
- Added optional `providerContext` for direct cubit/controller construction and updated all examples/docs/tests.


## [5.0.1] - 2026-08-21

### Removed

- Removed `SuperSearchDropdown` and `SuperSearchMultiDropdown`.
- Removed the search controllers, search box/overlay views, search configuration, positioning utilities, and `SuperSearchTheme` that existed to support those dropdown widgets.
- Removed the public search feature export from `super_pagination.dart`.
- Removed all dropdown-related example screens, including the Firestore search demo, and cleaned their routes/navigation entries.

### Changed

- Updated the example application theme and design-system tests after removing `SuperSearchTheme`.
- Updated README and skill guidance to describe the pagination-only public surface.

## [5.0.0] - 2026-08-21

### Added

- Six canonical datasource modes: `listFuture`, `listStream`, `pageFuture`, `pageStream`, `cursorFuture`, and `cursorStream`.
- `PagePaginationResult<T>` with `pageNumber`, `totalPages`, `items`, and `hasMore`.
- `OffsetPaginationResult<T>` with `offset`, `totalItems`, `items`, and `hasMore`.
- `CursorPaginationResult<T>` with `lastCursorNo`, `totalItems`, `items`, and `hasMore`.
- `SuperCursorPaginationRequest` for numeric cursor pagination.
- `SuperPaginationCubit.setRequest(...)` for safe runtime request replacement.
- Dedicated v5 example screens for datasource selection, ResultData, cursor pagination, custom requests, and runtime request switching.
- `SKILL.md` with v5 usage and migration guidance.

### Changed

- The datasource is now fixed for a cubit's lifetime; runtime query changes use `setRequest(...)`.
- Page/cursor result datasources now treat backend `hasMore` as authoritative instead of inferring end-of-list from item count.
- Example screens now use the explicit `listFuture` / `listStream` names for raw-list sources.
- `SuperPaginationMeta` now exposes `lastCursorNo` and `totalPages`; cursor `totalItems` maps to `totalCount`.

### Compatibility

- `SuperPaginationProvider.future` and `.stream` remain available as deprecated aliases.
- `mergeStreams` remains available as a compatibility utility in addition to the six canonical datasource modes.

## [4.2.0] - 2026-08-10

- Migrated the package and example application to the `super_core 3.3.0` theme API.
- Replaced `SuperThemeData.textTheme` reads with `context.superTextTheme` while preserving valid Material `Theme.of(context).textTheme` usage.
- Updated all `SuperMaterialThemeData.light/dark` call sites to provide the required `SuperTextTheme` values through `textTheme` and `primaryTextTheme`.
- Raised the minimum compatible `super_core` version to `3.3.0`.
- Documented explicit font-family handling after removal of the internal `_familyOf` inference helper in `super_core`.

## [4.1.4] - 2026-07-16

- Rebuilt the chat pagination example around the shared `super_core` design system.
- Replaced WhatsApp-specific surfaces and fixed colors with `SuperThemeData`, `SuperText`, `SuperCard`, shared radii, spacing, semantic colors, and the active Material color scheme.
- Redesigned the conversation header, search field, quick-navigation toolbar, message composer, state views, message actions, date separators, typing indicator, and message bubbles.
- Updated attachment cards to use shared surfaces, borders, and typography while preserving media-specific semantic accents.
- Made simulated typing/reply timers cancellable when the chat screen is disposed.

## [4.1.3] - 2026-07-16

- Replaced the example application's hand-built navigation panel with `super_navigation_sidebar` 2.3.0.
- Integrated the package's typed `NavigationSidebarController`, `NavigationShell`, responsive expanded/rail/drawer modes, breadcrumb/filter app bar, command palette, favorites, recents, and keyboard shortcut binder.
- Kept `TypedShellRoute` and GoRouter as the route source of truth while synchronizing the sidebar selection with every category and detail route.
- Derived sidebar colors and responsive metrics from the existing `super_core` theme rather than maintaining another local navigation theme.

## [4.1.2] - 2026-07-16

- Fixed the example dashboard card layout crash caused by an `Expanded` child receiving unbounded vertical constraints inside `SuperCard`.
- Increased the adaptive example-grid row extent and reserved a bounded description area so cards remain uniform without RenderFlex overflow.
- Added desktop and mobile widget coverage for the home dashboard layout.

## [4.1.1] - 2026-07-16

- Turned the example router shell into a functional `TypedShellRoute` with a persistent responsive navigation surface.
- Kept all category and detail routes on the shell navigator instead of escaping to the root navigator.
- Rebuilt the example landing experience as a responsive dashboard with a showcase hero, section switcher, metrics, search, and adaptive example grid.
- Aligned route transitions and navigation chrome with `super_core` motion, surfaces, borders, typography, and spacing tokens.
- Fixed duplicate named arguments in the generated-route source implementation.

## [4.1.0] - 2026-07-16

- Adopted `super_core` 1.2.0 as the package-wide GeniusLink design-system source.
- Added `SuperPaginationTheme` for loaders, empty states, errors, and retry actions.
- Reworked `SuperSearchTheme` so its defaults derive from `SuperThemeData`, the active `ColorScheme`, and shared radii instead of duplicated color constants.
- Updated built-in error builders and search fallbacks to use shared surfaces, typography, spacing, semantic colors, and responsive metrics.
- Rebuilt the example app theme, home catalog, product cards, and search-theming demo with `SuperMaterialThemeData`, `SuperDeviceMode`, and Super Core widgets.

## [4.0.0]

- Renamed the package to `super_pagination` and introduced the canonical
  `SuperPagination*` API aliases.
- Reorganized the implementation into Domain, Application, and Presentation
  modules with MVC-oriented controllers and views.
- Preserved the former `SuperPagination*` symbols and the `pagination.dart`
  entry point for source compatibility.
- Refactored the example application into feature-first Clean Architecture
  modules with MVC controllers, application contracts, a composition root, and
  compatibility exports for all former example import paths.

## [3.5.0] - 2026-05-06

### Added

- **Scroll Anchor Preservation** (spec 004). The package now preserves the
  user's viewport position across load-more appends and prevents
  chain-triggered auto-fetches from a single fast fling. Before each
  accepted load-more, a viewport anchor is captured (key → itemIndex →
  offset, depending on availability); after the appended items are laid
  out, the scroll is jumped back to the anchor in a post-frame callback.
  An internal suppression flag drops further automatic load-more triggers
  until the user initiates a new drag-scroll gesture.
- **`preserveScrollAnchorOnAppend` parameter** on every public wrapper
  (`SuperPaginationListView`, `SuperPaginationGridView`,
  `SuperPaginationStaggeredGridView`, …) and on `PaginateApiView`.
  Defaults to `true`; setting it to `false` reverts to pre-3.5.0
  framework default ("stick to the bottom" via maintainExtent) — capture,
  restore, and the suppression flag are all disabled.
- **Internal cubit hooks** `captureAnchorBeforeLoadMore`, `markUserScroll`,
  `setLoadMoreSuppressionEnabled`, and `skipLoadMoreSuppressionOnce` —
  marked `@internal` and consumed exclusively by `PaginateApiView`.
- **`scrollview_observer` integration** for `ListView`, `GridView`, and
  sliver-based `CustomScrollView` builds — used to read the
  last-fully-visible item synchronously at trigger time.

### Changed

- **Out-of-scope view types are master-switched at attach time.** When the
  widget mounts a `PageView`, `ReorderableListView`, custom builder, or
  any view with `reverse: true`, it calls
  `cubit.setLoadMoreSuppressionEnabled(false)` once so chain-triggered
  fetches fire freely (matching the pre-feature behavior for those
  views). The selection logic does not need to re-evaluate per fetch.
- **`StaggeredGridView` 80% threshold guard.** The widget's notification
  listener now requires `maxScrollExtent > 0` before firing — previously
  a layout where content fits the viewport (`maxScrollExtent == 0`)
  could trigger a load-more loop.
- **`StaggeredGridView` bottom widget rendering.** The bottom slot is now
  rendered only when actively loading more, on error, or at end-of-list
  with a `loadMoreNoMoreItemsBuilder` — previously the perpetual
  `BottomLoader` spinner could prevent `pumpAndSettle` from completing.

### Compatibility

No breaking changes. Existing `.withProvider(...)` and `.withCubit(...)`
call sites — including those passing an external `ScrollController` —
work unchanged. External controller listeners continue to fire; the
package never disposes a controller it did not allocate. The new
`preserveScrollAnchorOnAppend` parameter is purely additive.

## [3.4.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added

- **Optional `identityKey` parameter on `SuperPaginationCubit`** for opt-in cross-page item deduplication. When configured, the cubit drops items whose identity-key already appears in an earlier accumulated page before they are appended to the merged list. Default behaviour is unchanged — without `identityKey`, items are appended exactly as the provider returned them.
  ```dart
  SuperPaginationCubit<Product, SuperPaginationRequest>(
    request: SuperPaginationRequest(page: 1, pageSize: 20),
    provider: SuperPaginationProvider.future(api.fetchProducts),
    identityKey: (product) => product.id,
  );
  ```
- **Per-page in-flight key tracking (`_activeLoadMoreKey`).** Independent second-layer guard against duplicate concurrent fetches for the same page key (`"page:pageSize"`). Set in `fetchPaginatedList` before the first `await`; cleared on completion, error, cancellation, and reset.
- **`isComplete` flag on `_PageStreamEntry`.** Pages that have not yet delivered their first emission no longer contribute to the short-page end-of-list heuristic, eliminating premature `hasReachedEnd` during stream warm-up.

### Fixed

- **Rapid scroll could trigger duplicate concurrent load-more requests.** `SuperPaginationCubit._isFetching` is now set in `fetchPaginatedList` **before** `emit(isLoadingMore: true)` (previously inside `_fetch`, after a synchronous gap). Combined with the new `_activeLoadMoreKey` guard, ten rapid `fetchPaginatedList()` calls now produce exactly one provider call.
- **Stream providers double-called the factory function per page load.** `_fetch` now captures the stream instance once and reuses it for both the `.first` snapshot and the persistent `_attachStream` subscription when the stream is broadcast. Single-subscription streams still receive a second factory call (backwards-compatible fallback).
- **`_attachStream` could double-register the same page in the same generation.** A new generation-aware guard at the top of `_attachStream` skips re-registration when an entry for the page already exists at the current generation.
- **Empty load-more responses appended an empty page before end-of-list detection.** `_fetch` now early-returns on `pageItems.isEmpty` for load-more, sets `hasReachedEnd: true`, and does not append.
- **`_emitMergedLoaded` could prematurely set `hasReachedEnd` during stream warm-up.** The short-page heuristic now consults only pages flagged complete (`isComplete == true`).
- **External `cancelOngoingRequest()` left `_activeLoadMoreKey` set.** Cancellation now clears the per-page key so subsequent fetches for the same page are not blocked by a stale active key.

### Changed

- **Widget-level scroll trigger is wrapped in `SchedulerBinding.addPostFrameCallback`.** Multiple item builders calling `widget.fetchPaginatedList?.call()` during the same build pass now collapse to a single post-frame callback (defense in depth — the cubit-level guard is still authoritative).
- **`_computeHasNext` accepts an optional `serverHasNext` override.** Forward-compatible plumbing for cursor-aware providers; existing call sites are unchanged. Wiring `serverHasNext` through a public `PaginationResponse` wrapper is deferred to a future enhancement.

## [3.3.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added

- **Stream pagination now accumulates page subscriptions within a scope.** `SuperPaginationProvider.stream(...)` and `SuperPaginationProvider.mergeStreams(...)` register a new per-page subscription on every `loadMore()` instead of overwriting the previous one. Emissions on any active page update only that page's slice; the merged list reflects `page1 ∪ page2 ∪ … ∪ pageN` in page order.
- **Per-page error annotation on `SuperPaginationLoaded.pageErrors`.** When a stream provider's page errors, only that page's subscription is cancelled and the error is recorded at `state.pageErrors[page]`. Sibling pages keep emitting, and the failing page's last good slice remains visible in the merged view. `pageErrors` is `const <int, Object>{}` by default — additive and backward-compatible.
- **Dynamic end-of-pagination derivation.** A page whose latest emission has fewer items than `pageSize` (including `[]`) signals the end of pagination and gates `loadMore()`. Re-evaluated on every emission: a later emission that restores `count == pageSize` re-enables `loadMore()` in the same scope.

### Fixed

- **`MergedStreamSuperPaginationProvider` single-stream branch leaked subscriptions.** The branch now wraps the underlying stream in a controller, so cancelling the merged subscription cancels the underlying subscription. Symmetric with the multi-stream branch.
- **Merged streams never closed when all children completed.** The provider now tracks per-child completion and closes the controller after the last child completes (FR-023).
- **`_fetch` could mutate state after `dispose()`** when a future response arrived post-close. Added an `isClosed` check after the await so late responses are dropped silently (FR-005).
- **Stale stream emissions could update a new scope's state.** Each registered per-page entry is now tagged with a scope generation; emissions whose generation no longer matches the cubit's current generation are discarded (FR-016).

### Changed

- **`maxPagesInMemory` eviction propagates to the per-page subscription registry.** When the cap drops the oldest in-memory page, its stream subscription is cancelled and its `pageErrors` annotation is cleared. No new public knob — existing eviction semantics preserved.

## [3.2.0] - 2026-03-16

### Breaking Changes

- **All item operations now return `Future<bool>`**: `insertEmit`, `insertAllEmit`, `addOrUpdateEmit`, `removeItemEmit`, `removeAtEmit`, `removeWhereEmit`, `updateItemEmit`, `updateWhereEmit`, `clearItems`, `setItems` — all now return `Future<bool>` indicating success/failure instead of `void`/`bool`/`T?`/`int`

### Added

- **Partial view updates with animations**: Item add/update/remove operations now trigger targeted UI updates instead of full list rebuilds
  - `SliverAnimatedList` for ListView with insert/remove animations
  - `KeyedSubtree` + `findChildIndexCallback` for GridView, PageView, StaggeredGridView, and ReorderableListView
  - `PaginationOperation` sealed class for tracking operation metadata
- **`refreshItem` method**: Refresh a specific item from the server
  ```dart
  await cubit.refreshItem(
    (item) => item.id == productId,
    (currentItem) => api.fetchProduct(currentItem.id),
  );
  ```
- **New widget parameters**:
  - `itemKeyBuilder` — unique key per item for efficient partial updates and animations
  - `buildWhen` — control when `BlocBuilder` rebuilds
  - `insertItemAnimationBuilder` — custom insert animation
  - `removeItemAnimationBuilder` — custom remove animation
  - `animationDuration` — animation duration (default: 300ms)

### Usage

```dart
// All operations now return Future<bool>
final success = await cubit.insertEmit(newProduct);
final removed = await cubit.removeItemEmit(product);
final updated = await cubit.updateItemEmit(
  (item) => item.id == id,
  (item) => item.copyWith(price: newPrice),
);

// Refresh item from server
await cubit.refreshItem(
  (item) => item.id == productId,
  (currentItem) => api.fetchProduct(currentItem.id),
);

// Enable animations with itemKeyBuilder
SuperPaginationListView.withCubit(
  cubit: cubit,
  itemKeyBuilder: (item, index) => item.id,
  itemBuilder: (context, items, index) => ProductTile(product: items[index]),
);
```

## [3.1.3] - 2026-02-04

### Added

- **Auto-retry on connectivity restored**: Network errors are now automatically retried when internet connection is restored
  - New `connectivityStream` parameter in `SuperPaginationCubit` constructor for automatic monitoring
  - New `onConnectivityRestored()` method for manual notification
  - New `isNetworkError` getter to check if last error was network-related
  - Detects common network errors: SocketException, connection refused/reset/timeout, failed host lookup, etc.

### Usage

```dart
// Option 1: Using connectivity_plus package with stream
final cubit = SuperPaginationCubit<Product, SuperPaginationRequest>(
  request: request,
  provider: provider,
  connectivityStream: Connectivity().onConnectivityChanged
      .map((result) => result != ConnectivityResult.none),
);

// Option 2: Manual notification
Connectivity().onConnectivityChanged.listen((result) {
  if (result != ConnectivityResult.none) {
    cubit.onConnectivityRestored();
  }
});
```

---

## [3.1.2] - 2026-02-03

### Changed

- **ErrorRetryStrategy**: Changed default from `automatic` to `none`
  - Errors no longer trigger automatic retries on the next `fetchPaginatedList()` call
  - This prevents unwanted retry loops when API calls fail
  - Use `ErrorRetryStrategy.automatic` explicitly if you want the old behavior
  - Use `retryAfterError()` for explicit retry control, or `refreshPaginatedList()` to reset

### Notes

- **hasReachedEnd**: Already correctly set to `true` when returned items < pageSize
- **Page increment**: Page number only increments after successful fetch (existing behavior)

---

## [3.1.1] - 2026-01-09

### Added

- **SuperSearchConfig**: New `skipDebounceOnEmpty` parameter (default: `true`)
  - When `true` and `searchOnEmpty` is also `true`, search triggers immediately when text is cleared
  - Skips debounce delay for empty text to show all data instantly
  - Useful for providing immediate feedback when user clears the search field

- **SuperSearchConfig**: New `fetchOnInit` parameter (default: `false`)
  - When `true` and `searchOnEmpty` is also `true`, data is fetched immediately when the controller is created
  - Pre-loads data before the overlay is shown for instant display
  - Useful for scenarios where you want data ready before user interaction

---

## [3.1.0] - 2026-01-08

### Added

- **SuperSearchMultiDropdown**: New `displayMode` parameter to switch between `SearchDisplayMode.overlay` (default) and `SearchDisplayMode.bottomSheet`
- **SearchDisplayMode**: New enum with `overlay` and `bottomSheet` options
- **SuperSearchBottomSheetConfig**: New configuration class for bottom sheet appearance with options:
  - `title` / `titleBuilder`: Bottom sheet title
  - `confirmText` / `cancelText`: Button labels
  - `showSelectedCount`: Show selection count in title
  - `showClearAllButton`: Show clear all button
  - `heightFactor`: Bottom sheet height (0.0 to 1.0)
  - `showDragHandle`: Show drag indicator
- **New parameters for SuperSearchMultiDropdown**:
  - `hintText`: Custom hint text for the trigger button
  - `onMaxSelectionsReached`: Callback when max selections limit is reached

### Fixed

- **SuperSearchOverlay**: Fixed `onSelected` callback not being called when item is selected. The callback now always fires with nullable key (`K?`) to support cases where `keyExtractor` is not provided.
- **SuperSearchOverlay**: Fixed overlay positioning when appearing above the search box. The overlay now anchors from the bottom and grows upward, ensuring it always touches the input field.

---

## [3.0.0] - 2026-01-07

### Breaking Changes

#### Unified Selection Callbacks 🔄

The selection callbacks have been simplified and unified into a single `onSelected` callback that returns both the item and its key.

**SuperSearchDropdown:**

| Old API | New API |
|---------|---------|
| `onItemSelected: (item) => ...` | `onSelected: (item, key) => ...` |
| `onKeySelected: (key) => ...` | _(merged into onSelected)_ |

**SuperSearchMultiDropdown:**

| Old API | New API |
|---------|---------|
| `onSelectionChanged: (items) => ...` | `onSelected: (items, keys) => ...` |
| `onKeysChanged: (keys) => ...` | _(merged into onSelected)_ |

**Migration:**

```dart
// Before (v2.x)
SuperSearchDropdown<Product, int>.withProvider(
  onItemSelected: (product) => print(product.name),
  onKeySelected: (id) => setState(() => selectedId = id),
  // ...
)

// After (v3.0)
SuperSearchDropdown<Product, int>.withProvider(
  keyExtractor: (product) => product.id,
  onSelected: (product, id) {
    print(product.name);
    setState(() => selectedId = id);
  },
  // ...
)
```

```dart
// Before (v2.x)
SuperSearchMultiDropdown<Product, int>.withProvider(
  onSelectionChanged: (products) => print(products.length),
  onKeysChanged: (ids) => setState(() => selectedIds = ids),
  // ...
)

// After (v3.0)
SuperSearchMultiDropdown<Product, int>.withProvider(
  keyExtractor: (product) => product.id,
  onSelected: (products, ids) {
    print(products.length);
    setState(() => selectedIds = ids);
  },
  // ...
)
```

---

## [2.7.0] - 2026-01-05

### Added

#### Key-Based Selection for SuperSearchDropdown 🔑

New powerful key-based selection feature that allows selecting items by their unique key/ID instead of by object reference. This is especially useful when working with API data where object instances may differ but the underlying ID is the same.

**New Parameters for SuperSearchDropdown:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `keyExtractor` | `K Function(T item)?` | Extracts unique key from item |
| `selectedKey` | `K?` | Currently selected key (for controlled selection) |
| `onKeySelected` | `void Function(K key, T item)?` | Called when item is selected with its key |
| `selectedKeyLabelBuilder` | `String Function(K key)?` | Builds display label from key when item not loaded |

**New Parameters for SuperSearchMultiDropdown:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `keyExtractor` | `K Function(T item)?` | Extracts unique key from item |
| `selectedKeys` | `Set<K>?` | Currently selected keys (for controlled selection) |
| `onKeysChanged` | `void Function(Set<K> keys, List<T> items)?` | Called when selection changes with keys |
| `initialSelectedKeys` | `Set<K>?` | Pre-selected keys on widget load |

**Usage Example - Single Selection:**
```dart
SuperSearchDropdown<Product, int>.withProvider(
  keyExtractor: (product) => product.id,
  selectedKey: selectedProductId, // int
  onKeySelected: (id, product) {
    setState(() => selectedProductId = id);
    print('Selected product ID: $id');
  },
  // When item isn't loaded yet, show the ID
  selectedKeyLabelBuilder: (id) => 'Product #$id',
  // ... other properties
)
```

**Usage Example - Multi Selection:**
```dart
SuperSearchMultiDropdown<Product, int>.withProvider(
  keyExtractor: (product) => product.id,
  selectedKeys: selectedProductIds, // Set<int>
  onKeysChanged: (ids, products) {
    setState(() => selectedProductIds = ids);
    print('Selected ${ids.length} products');
  },
  initialSelectedKeys: {1, 2, 3}, // Pre-select by IDs
  // ... other properties
)
```

**Benefits:**
- **Pre-selection before data loads**: Select by ID even when item hasn't been fetched
- **Consistent state management**: Use primitive keys instead of object references
- **API-friendly**: Works naturally with REST APIs returning IDs
- **Form integration**: Easily bind to form fields with ID values

---

#### Initial/Pre-Selection Support 📋

Enhanced support for pre-populating search dropdowns with initial values, perfect for edit forms and default selections.

**SuperSearchDropdown:**
- `initialSelectedValue`: Set an initial item object
- `selectedKey` + `selectedKeyLabelBuilder`: Pre-select by key with placeholder label

**SuperSearchMultiDropdown:**
- `initialSelectedValues`: Set initial list of item objects
- `initialSelectedKeys`: Set initial set of keys

**Form Usage Example:**
```dart
// Edit form with pre-selected category
SuperSearchDropdown<Category, int>.withProvider(
  initialSelectedValue: existingProduct.category,
  // OR use key-based pre-selection
  selectedKey: existingProduct.categoryId,
  selectedKeyLabelBuilder: (id) => 'Category #$id (loading...)',
  showSelected: true,
  onKeySelected: (categoryId, category) {
    formData.categoryId = categoryId;
  },
)
```

---

#### New Example Screens 📱

Added two comprehensive example screens demonstrating the new features:

1. **Key-Based Selection Screen**: Shows 4 examples of key-based selection:
   - Basic key extraction and selection
   - Pre-selection by key with pending label
   - Multi-select with key sets
   - Custom key label builder display

2. **Initial Selection Screen**: Shows 4 examples of initial value handling:
   - Initial selected value for single dropdown
   - Form integration with default values
   - Multi-select with initial values list
   - Conditional initial value based on context

---

### Fixed

- Fixed type inference issues in `SuperSearchController` where `Object?` couldn't be assigned to generic type `K?`
- Fixed null check operator usage on nullable type parameters in `selectedKeyLabel` getter
- Renamed scroll mixin and typedefs for consistency:
  - `SuperPaginationScrollToItem` → `PaginationScrollToItem`
  - `SuperPaginationScrollToIndex` → `PaginationScrollToIndex`
  - `SuperPaginationScrollToItemMixin` → `PaginationScrollToItemMixin`

---

## [2.6.0] - 2026-01-02

### Added

#### Scroll Navigation Methods - Programmatic Scrolling 🎯

New scroll navigation methods in `SuperPaginationCubit` using the `scrollview_observer` package. These methods allow you to programmatically scroll to specific items in your list or grid views.

**New Methods:**

| `jumpFirstWhere(bool Function(T) test, {...})` | Jump to first item matching predicate |
| `scrollToIndex(int index, {bool animate})` | Convenience method combining animate/jump |
| `scrollFirstWhere(bool Function(T) test, {bool animate})` | Convenience method combining animate/jump |

**Observer Controller Management:**

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `attachListObserverController(ListObserverController)` | Attach controller for ListView |
| `attachGridObserverController(GridObserverController)` | Attach controller for GridView |
| `detachListObserverController()` | Detach list observer controller |
| `detachGridObserverController()` | Detach grid observer controller |
| `detachAllObserverControllers()` | Detach all observer controllers |

**Properties:**

| Property | Type | Description |

**Usage Example:**
```dart
// Create the observer controller
final scrollController = ScrollController();
final observerController = ListObserverController(controller: scrollController);

// Attach to cubit
cubit.attachListObserverController(observerController);

// Navigate to specific index with animation
await cubit.animateToIndex(
  10,
  duration: Duration(milliseconds: 500),
  curve: Curves.easeOutCubic,
  alignment: 0.5, // Center in viewport
);

// Jump instantly to an index
cubit.jumpToIndex(0);

// Find and scroll to first matching item
await cubit.animateFirstWhere(
  (message) => message.id == targetId,
  alignment: 0.3,
);

// In your widget, wrap with ListViewObserver
ListViewObserver(
  controller: observerController,
  child: SuperPagination<Message, SuperPaginationRequest>.listViewWithCubit(
    cubit: cubit,
    scrollController: scrollController,
    itemBuilder: (context, items, index) => MessageWidget(items[index]),
  ),
)
```

**Parameters:**

All navigation methods support these parameters:
- `duration` - Animation duration (default: 300ms)
- `curve` - Animation curve (default: Curves.easeInOut)
- `alignment` - Position in viewport (0.0 = top, 0.5 = center, 1.0 = bottom)
- `padding` - Additional padding for alignment
- `isFixedHeight` - Whether items have fixed height (optimization)
- `sliverContext` - Context for sliver-based scrolling

---

#### Chat Screen Example 💬

New comprehensive chat screen example demonstrating scroll navigation features:
- Animated scroll to specific messages
- Jump to unread messages
- Search and scroll to matching messages
- Message highlighting on navigation
- Real-time message insertion with auto-scroll

---

## [2.5.1] - 2026-01-02

### Fixed

#### Concurrent Request Prevention 🔒

Fixed an issue where multiple fetch requests could be executed simultaneously, causing duplicate data or race conditions.

**The Problem:**
- When `fetchPaginatedList()` was called multiple times rapidly (e.g., from multiple widget rebuilds), each call would trigger a separate network request
- This led to duplicate items, race conditions, and wasted network resources

**The Solution:**
- Added `_isFetching` flag to track ongoing fetch operations
- New requests are now queued/ignored while a fetch is in progress
- The cubit now exposes `isFetching` getter to check the current state

```dart
// Check if a fetch is in progress
if (!cubit.isFetching) {
  cubit.fetchPaginatedList();
}
```

---

#### Error Retry Strategy - Prevent Infinite Retries 🛡️

Added configurable error retry strategy to prevent infinite retry loops when server errors occur.

**The Problem:**
- When a server error occurred, widget rebuilds would trigger automatic retries endlessly
- This caused unnecessary network load and poor user experience

**The Solution:**
- New `ErrorRetryStrategy` enum with three modes:
  - `automatic`: Default behavior, retries on next fetch call
  - `manual`: Requires explicit `retryAfterError()` call
  - `none`: No automatic retry, requires `refreshPaginatedList()`

**Usage:**
```dart
SuperPaginationCubit<Product, SuperPaginationRequest>(
  request: request,
  provider: provider,
  // Prevent automatic retries on error
  errorRetryStrategy: ErrorRetryStrategy.manual,
);

// Later, when user taps retry button:
if (cubit.hasError) {
  cubit.retryAfterError();
}
```

**New Cubit Properties:**

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `isFetching` | `bool` | Whether a fetch is in progress |
| `hasError` | `bool` | Whether the last fetch resulted in an error |
| `lastError` | `Exception?` | The last error that occurred |

**New Cubit Methods:**

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `retryAfterError()` | Explicitly retry after an error (for manual strategy) |
| `clearError()` | Clear error state without retrying |

#### Overlay Value Parameter - Context-Aware Content 🎯

New feature that allows passing a value when showing the overlay programmatically. This enables you to determine what content to display in the overlay based on the passed value.

**Usage Example:**
```dart
// Show overlay for user search
controller.showOverlay(value: 'user');

// Show overlay for category selection
controller.showOverlay(value: CategoryType.products);

// Show overlay with numeric identifier
controller.showOverlay(value: 1);

// In your widget, check the value:
if (controller.overlayValue == 'user') {
  return UserSearchContent();
}

// Type-safe access
final categoryId = controller.getOverlayValue<int>(); // Returns int? or null
```

**New Controller Methods:**

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `showOverlay({Object? value})` | Show overlay with optional context value |
| `hideOverlay({bool clearValue = true})` | Hide overlay, optionally preserving the value |
| `toggleOverlay({Object? value})` | Toggle visibility with optional value |
| `setOverlayValue(Object? value)` | Set value without showing overlay |
| `clearOverlayValue()` | Clear the overlay value |
| `getOverlayValue<V>()` | Type-safe value access, returns null if type mismatch |

**New Controller Properties:**

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `overlayValue` | `Object?` | Current overlay value |
| `hasOverlayValue` | `bool` | Whether a value is set |

#### Overlay Animation Types - 13 Animation Styles 🎬

New powerful animation system for overlay show/hide transitions. Choose from 13 different animation types to match your app's design.

**Available Animation Types:**

| Animation Type | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `fade` | Simple fade in/out (default) |
| `scale` | Scale animation from center |
| `fadeScale` | Combined scale with fade |
| `slideDown` | Slide from top with fade |
| `slideUp` | Slide from bottom with fade |
| `slideLeft` | Slide from left with fade |
| `slideRight` | Slide from right with fade |
| `bounceScale` | Elastic bounce scale effect |
| `elasticScale` | Smooth elastic scale with overshoot |
| `flipX` | 3D flip on X axis |
| `flipY` | 3D flip on Y axis |
| `zoomIn` | Zoom from 50% to 100% |
| `none` | Instant show/hide, no animation |

**Usage Example:**
```dart
SuperSearchDropdown<Product>.withProvider(
  // ... other properties
  overlayConfig: SuperSearchOverlayConfig(
    animationType: OverlayAnimationType.bounceScale,
    animationDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 300),
    animationCurve: Curves.easeOutBack,
  ),
)
```

**New Configuration Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `animationType` | `OverlayAnimationType` | `fade` | Animation style for show/hide |

#### Scroll-Aware Overlay Positioning 📜

The overlay now tracks the search field position in real-time when the user scrolls. This ensures the overlay stays correctly positioned relative to its target, even in scrollable content.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time position updates during scrolling
- Automatic attachment to nearest scrollable ancestor
- Screen orientation/size change handling
- Can be disabled via configuration

**Usage Example:**
```dart
SuperSearchDropdown<Product>.withProvider(
  // ... other properties
  overlayConfig: SuperSearchOverlayConfig(
    followTargetOnScroll: true, // Default: true
  ),
)
```

**New Configuration Parameter:**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `followTargetOnScroll` | `bool` | `true` | Whether overlay follows target on scroll |

---

#### High-Accuracy Position Tracking 🎯

Enhanced position tracking system for maximum accuracy when the overlay follows the search field during scrolling.

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Ticker-based monitoring**: Continuous position checking every frame for instant updates
- **Multi-level scroll tracking**: Attaches to all ancestor `ScrollPosition` objects
- **NotificationListener wrapper**: Catches scroll events from any scrollable in the widget tree
- **Super update scheduling**: Uses `addPostFrameCallback` for smooth, non-blocking updates
- **Optimized rebuilds**: Only triggers overlay rebuild when position actually changes

**How it works:**
```dart
// Tracks position changes every frame
Ticker _positionTicker;
Offset? _lastKnownPosition;

void _onPositionTick(Duration elapsed) {
  final currentPosition = renderBox.localToGlobal(Offset.zero);
  // Only update if position actually changed
  if (_lastKnownPosition != currentPosition) {
    _lastKnownPosition = currentPosition;
    _overlayEntry!.markNeedsBuild();
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Works with nested scrollables (e.g., ListView inside PageView)
- Handles keyboard appearance/disappearance
- Responds to screen rotation and resize
- Zero lag between scroll and overlay position update

## [2.3.2] - 2025-12-28

### Changed

#### Parameter Rename: initialSelectedItem → initialSelectedValue 🔄

Renamed `initialSelectedItem` to `initialSelectedValue` for consistency and clarity.

```dart
// Before (v2.3.0 - v2.3.1)
SuperSearchDropdown<Product>.withProvider(
  initialSelectedItem: preSelectedProduct,
  // ...
)

// After (v2.3.2+)
SuperSearchDropdown<Product>.withProvider(
  initialSelectedValue: preSelectedProduct,
  // ...
)
```

#### Removed: initialValue Parameter ❌

The `initialValue` parameter (added in v2.3.1) has been removed. Use `initialSelectedValue` instead to pre-select an item.

#### SuperSearchTheme Auto-Detection 🎨

`SuperSearchTheme.of(context)` now automatically detects the system theme (light/dark) when no explicit theme extension is provided.

**Before (v2.3.1):**
```dart
// Always fell back to light theme
SuperSearchTheme.of(context); // → SuperSearchTheme.light()
```

**After (v2.3.2):**
```dart
// Now respects system brightness
SuperSearchTheme.of(context);
// → SuperSearchTheme.dark() if system is in dark mode
// → SuperSearchTheme.light() if system is in light mode
```

This means SuperSearch widgets will automatically adapt to the system theme without requiring explicit `SuperSearchTheme.dark()` or `SuperSearchTheme.light()` configuration.

#### Show Selected Mode for SuperSearchDropdown 🎯

New `showSelected` feature that displays the selected item instead of the search box after selection.

**Basic Usage:**
```dart
SuperSearchDropdown<Product>.withProvider(
  // ... other properties
  showSelected: true,
  onItemSelected: (product) {
    print('Selected: ${product.name}');
  },
)
```

**Custom Selected Item Display:**
```dart
SuperSearchDropdown<Product>.withProvider(
  // ... other properties
  showSelected: true,
  selectedItemBuilder: (context, product, onClear) => Container(
    decoration: BoxDecoration(
      color: Theme.of(context).colorScheme.primaryContainer,
      borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(12),
    ),
    child: ListTile(
      leading: CircleAvatar(child: Text(product.name[0])),
      title: Text(product.name),
      subtitle: Text('\$${product.price}'),
      trailing: IconButton(
        icon: Icon(Icons.close),
        onPressed: onClear, // Clears selection and shows search box
      ),
    ),
  ),
)
```

**With Initial Selection:**
```dart
SuperSearchDropdown<Product>.withProvider(
  // ... other properties
  showSelected: true,

controller.clearSelection();
controller.clearSelection(requestFocus: false); // Don't auto-focus
```

**Behavior:**
- When `showSelected: true` and an item is selected, the search box is replaced with the selected item display
- Tapping on the selected item (or the clear button) clears the selection and shows the search box again
- The selected item is automatically styled using `SuperSearchTheme` colors
- If `selectedItemBuilder` is not provided, a default display using `itemBuilder` is used

## [0.1.4] - 2025-12-18

### Added

#### Sorting & Orders Feature 📊

New powerful sorting functionality that allows programmatic control over item ordering:

#### Sorted Insertion (Performance Fix) ⚡

Item insertion methods now respect the active sort order by inserting items directly at the correct sorted position using binary search. This prevents visual flickering that occurred when items were added then re-sorted.

**Improved Methods:**
- `insertEmit()` - Inserts items at correct sorted position
- `insertAllEmit()` - Uses efficient merge algorithm for batch insertions
- `addOrUpdateEmit()` - Positions new items correctly; repositions updated items if sort field changed
- `updateItemEmit()` - Repositions item if sort field changes
- `updateWhereEmit()` - Batch repositions multiple updated items efficiently

**Benefits:**
- **No Visual Flickering**: Items appear directly in their final position
- **Efficient Algorithm**: Binary search for single insertions, merge sort for batches
- **Automatic**: Works transparently when sort order is active
- **Backward Compatible**: Falls back to index-based insertion when no sorting is active

**New Classes:**
- `SortOrder<T>` - Defines how items should be sorted
- `SortOrderCollection<T>` - Manages multiple sort orders with an active selection
- `SortDirection` - Enum for ascending/descending direction

**Cubit Constructor Parameter:**
- `orders: SortOrderCollection<T>?` - Set initial sorting configuration

**New Cubit Methods:**
- `setActiveOrder(String orderId)` - Change the active sort order
- `resetOrder()` - Reset to default sort order
- `clearOrder()` - Remove sorting (show original order)
- `addSortOrder(SortOrder<T> order)` - Add a new sort order dynamically
- `removeSortOrder(String orderId)` - Remove a sort order
- `sortBy(ItemComparator<T> comparator)` - One-time sort with custom comparator
- `setOrders(SortOrderCollection<T>? orders)` - Replace entire orders collection

**New Cubit Properties:**
- `orders` - Get current sort order collection
- `activeOrder` - Get currently active sort order
- `activeOrderId` - Get ID of active sort order
- `availableOrders` - Get list of all available sort orders

**State Updates:**
- `SuperPaginationLoaded.activeOrderId` - Track current sort order in state

### Usage Examples

```dart
// Define sort orders
final orders = SortOrderCollection<Product>(
  orders: [
    SortOrder.byField(
      id: 'name',
      label: 'Name (A-Z)',
      fieldSelector: (p) => p.name,
      direction: SortDirection.ascending,
    ),
    SortOrder.byField(
      id: 'price_low',
      label: 'Price: Low to High',
      fieldSelector: (p) => p.price,
      direction: SortDirection.ascending,
    ),
    SortOrder.byField(
      id: 'price_high',
      label: 'Price: High to Low',
      fieldSelector: (p) => p.price,
      direction: SortDirection.descending,
    ),
    SortOrder<Product>(
      id: 'custom',
      label: 'Custom Sort',
      comparator: (a, b) => a.rating.compareTo(b.rating),
    ),
  ],
  defaultOrderId: 'name',
);

// Create cubit with orders
final cubit = SuperPaginationCubit<Product, SuperPaginationRequest>(
  request: SuperPaginationRequest(page: 1, pageSize: 20),
  provider: SuperPaginationProvider.future(fetchProducts),
  orders: orders,
);

// Change sort order programmatically
cubit.setActiveOrder('price_low');  // Sort by price ascending
cubit.setActiveOrder('price_high'); // Sort by price descending
cubit.resetOrder();                 // Reset to default (name)
cubit.clearOrder();                 // Remove sorting

// Add new sort order dynamically
cubit.addSortOrder(SortOrder.byField(
  id: 'newest',
  label: 'Newest First',
  fieldSelector: (p) => p.createdAt,
  direction: SortDirection.descending,
));

// One-time custom sort
cubit.sortBy((a, b) => a.stock.compareTo(b.stock));

// Access current order in state
if (state is SuperPaginationLoaded<Product>) {
  print('Current sort: ${state.activeOrderId}');
}
```

  request: SuperPaginationRequest(page: 1, pageSize: 20),
  provider: SuperPaginationProvider.future(fetchProducts),
  itemBuilder: (context, items, index) => ProductTile(items[index]),
)

// After (using specialized widget class)
SuperPaginationListView.withProvider(
  request: SuperPaginationRequest(page: 1, pageSize: 20),
  provider: SuperPaginationProvider.future(fetchProducts),
  itemBuilder: (context, items, index) => ProductTile(items[index]),
)

// GridView example
SuperPaginationGridView.withProvider(
  request: SuperPaginationRequest(page: 1, pageSize: 20),
  provider: SuperPaginationProvider.future(fetchProducts),
  gridDelegate: SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount(crossAxisCount: 2),
  itemBuilder: (context, items, index) => ProductCard(items[index]),
)

// External cubit example
final cubit = SuperPaginationCubit<Product, SuperPaginationRequest>(
  request: SuperPaginationRequest(page: 1, pageSize: 20),
  provider: SuperPaginationProvider.future(fetchProducts),
  dataAge: Duration(minutes: 5),
);

SuperPaginationListView.withCubit(
  cubit: cubit,
  itemBuilder: (context, items, index) => ProductTile(items[index]),

## [0.1.2] - 2025-12-17

### Added

#### Data Age & Automatic Expiration ⏰

New feature for automatic data invalidation and refresh when using cubit as a global variable:

**New Parameters:**
- `dataAge: Duration?` - Configure how long data remains valid after fetching

**New Properties on SuperPaginationCubit:**
- `dataAge` - Get the configured data age duration
- `lastFetchTime` - Get the timestamp of the last successful data fetch
- `isDataExpired` - Check if data has expired based on the configured dataAge
- `checkAndResetIfExpired()` - Check expiration and reset if expired (returns `true` if reset)

**New Properties on SuperPaginationLoaded State:**
- `fetchedAt: DateTime?` - Timestamp when data was initially fetched
- `dataExpiredAt: DateTime?` - Timestamp when data will expire (null if no expiration)

**Automatic Behavior:**
- When `fetchPaginatedList()` is called, it automatically checks if data has expired
- If expired, the cubit resets to initial state and triggers a fresh data load
- Perfect for global cubits that persist across screen navigations
- **Timer refreshes on any data interaction:** insert, update, remove, load more
- This ensures active users don't experience unexpected data resets

### Usage Example

```dart
// Create a global cubit with 5-minute data age
final productsCubit = SuperPaginationCubit<Product, SuperPaginationRequest>(
  request: SuperPaginationRequest(page: 1, pageSize: 20),
  provider: SuperPaginationProvider.future(fetchProducts),
  dataAge: Duration(minutes: 5), // Data expires after 5 minutes
);

// When re-entering the screen, data is automatically refreshed if expired
// Or manually check expiration:
if (productsCubit.isDataExpired) {
  print('Data is stale, will refresh on next fetch');
}

// Access expiration info from state
if (state is SuperPaginationLoaded<Product>) {
  print('Data fetched at: ${state.fetchedAt}');
  print('Data expires at: ${state.dataExpiredAt}');
}
```

## [0.1.1] - 2025-12-17

### Added

#### Cubit Data Operations 🎛️

New programmatic data operations accessible from anywhere in your app via the cubit:

**Insert Operations:**
- `insertEmit(item, {index})` - Insert a single item at specified index (default: 0)
- `insertAllEmit(items, {index})` - Insert multiple items at specified index

**Remove Operations:**
- `removeItemEmit(item)` - Remove an item by reference, returns `true` if found
- `removeAtEmit(index)` - Remove item at index, returns the removed item or `null`
- `removeWhereEmit(test)` - Remove all items matching predicate, returns count removed

**Update Operations:**
- `updateItemEmit(matcher, updater)` - Update first matching item, returns `true` if updated
- `updateWhereEmit(matcher, updater)` - Update all matching items, returns count updated

**Other Operations:**
- `clearItems()` - Clear all items from the list
- `reload()` - Reload data from the beginning (alias for `refreshPaginatedList`)
- `setItems(items)` - Set the list to a completely new set of items
- `currentItems` - Getter to access current list of items (read-only)

#### Example App
- **Data Operations Screen** - New example demonstrating all cubit data operations:
  - Interactive buttons to test each operation
  - Long-press to remove items
  - Visual feedback for all operations

### Usage Examples

```dart
// Get the cubit reference
final cubit = SuperPaginationCubit<Product, SuperPaginationRequest>(...);

// Insert operations
cubit.insertEmit(newProduct);
cubit.insertEmit(newProduct, index: 5);
cubit.insertAllEmit([product1, product2, product3]);

// Remove operations
cubit.removeItemEmit(productToRemove);
cubit.removeAtEmit(0); // Remove first item
cubit.removeWhereEmit((item) => item.price > 100); // Remove expensive items

// Update operations
cubit.updateItemEmit(
  (item) => item.id == '123',
  (item) => item.copyWith(price: item.price * 0.9), // Apply discount
);
cubit.updateWhereEmit(
  (item) => item.category == 'sale',
  (item) => item.copyWith(price: item.price * 0.8),
);

// Other operations
cubit.clearItems();
cubit.reload();
cubit.setItems(customProductList);

// Access current items
final items = cubit.currentItems;
print('Total items: ${items.length}');
```

## [0.1.0] - 2025-12-01

### Added

- **New Constructor**: `SuperPagination.column` and `SuperPagination.columnWithCubit` for non-scrollable column layouts.
- **External Cubit Support**: Added `...WithCubit` named constructors for all view types (`listViewWithCubit`, `gridViewWithCubit`, `pageViewWithCubit`, `staggeredGridViewWithCubit`, `rowWithCubit`) to easily use externally created Cubits.
- **Exposed Parameters**: Added missing parameters to all convenience constructors:
  - `scrollController`: For external scroll control.
  - `cacheExtent`: For viewport caching customization.
  - `invisibleItemsThreshold`: For configuring smart preloading.
  - **State Builders**: `firstPageLoadingBuilder`, `firstPageErrorBuilder`, `firstPageEmptyBuilder`, `loadMoreLoadingBuilder`, `loadMoreErrorBuilder`, `loadMoreNoMoreItemsBuilder`.

### Breaking Changes ⚠️

- **Constructor Renaming**:
  - `SuperPagination(...)` is now `SuperPagination.withProvider(...)`.
  - `SuperPagination.cubit(...)` is now `SuperPagination.withCubit(...)`.
  - All named constructors now have explicit suffixes:
    - `listView` -> `listViewWithProvider` / `listViewWithCubit`
    - `gridView` -> `gridViewWithProvider` / `gridViewWithCubit`
    - `pageView` -> `pageViewWithProvider` / `pageViewWithCubit`
    - `staggeredGridView` -> `staggeredGridViewWithProvider` / `staggeredGridViewWithCubit`
    - `column` -> `columnWithProvider` / `columnWithCubit`
    - `row` -> `rowWithProvider` / `rowWithCubit`
    - `reorderableListView` -> `reorderableListViewWithProvider` / `reorderableListViewWithCubit`

- **Removed Convenience Widgets**: `SuperPaginatedListView` and `SuperPaginatedGridView` have been removed. Use `SuperPagination` directly.
- **API Unification**:
  - `childBuilder` is renamed to `itemBuilder`.
  - `itemBuilder` signature changed from `(context, item, index)` to `(context, items, index)`. You must now access the item using `items[index]`.
- **Configuration**:
  - Use `itemBuilderType: PaginateBuilderType.gridView` for grid layouts.
  - Use `itemBuilderType: PaginateBuilderType.listView` (default) for list layouts.

### Changed

- Updated all example screens to use the new constructor names.
- Improved API clarity by explicitly distinguishing between `Provider` (internal Cubit creation) and `Cubit` (external Cubit injection) usage.
- Updated `SuperPagination` to be the single entry point for all pagination types.
- Updated `emptyWidget`, `loadingWidget`, and `bottomLoader` to accept `Widget` directly.
- Updated `separator` to accept `Widget` directly.
